   <p>
	  A Cathode is an electrode by which electrons enter a system like an electrolytic cell or an electron tube.
	   <br>
	  A Cathode Ray on the other hand is a beam of electrons leaving the Cathode in a discharge tube or released by a heated filament
	  in certain electron tubes.

	  A vacuum tube is an electron tube with a near vacuum(the air has been withdrawn/extracted).
	   <br>
	   A Cathode Ray Tube or CRT is a vacuum tube whereby images are produced when an electron beam strikes a phosphorescent screen.

	   <p>A cathode ray tube is made up of several components that starts with a vacuum sealed tube. One one side is the electron gun which produces electrons. It's then
          accelerated using a positive charge. A small hole in the anode allowssome electrons to go by creating a beam of electrons.It's deflected with electromagnetic 
          coils and when it hits a phosphorescent screen light is emitted.<br><br> In order to produce an image complex signals are implemented to the deflecting coils as well as 
       the device that controls the beam intensity. Cathode ray tubes are known to be used in some computer monitors, television sets, automated teller machines, video game 
       machines, video cameras, oscilloscopes and radar displays.  </p>

   <h2>Who invented the first CRT?</h2>
	  <p>During 1897, the first CRT or Braun tube as it was invented by Karl Braun. Through a series of experiment whereby he proved the
      existence of the electron he invented the cathode ray tube. The name electron was not used back then so rather than electron beam tube, it was cathode ray tube.
